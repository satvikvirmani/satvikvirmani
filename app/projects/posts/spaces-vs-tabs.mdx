Creating the playmedia project was an exciting journey that combined my love for coding and music. As someone who enjoys listening to music while working, I wanted to create a Python module that could handle media files seamlessly. The idea was to give users the ability to play, control, and manage their media files directly from their Python scripts.

### Installation and Dependencies
To make the module accessible, I ensured that it could be easily installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install playmedia
```

The module relies on VLC Media Player, which is a robust media player that supports various file formats. This dependency allowed me to focus on the moduleâ€™s functionality without worrying about the underlying media processing.

### Usage
The core of the *playmedia* module revolves around two classes: File and Files.

- File Class: This class is designed for handling individual media files. You can initiate it by passing the path to the media file, and then use various methods to control playback. Whether you want to start, pause, or stop a file, adjust the volume, or even modify its metadata, the File class has you covered.

- Files Class: For those who work with multiple media files, the Files class is perfect. You can initiate it with either a directory path or a list of file paths. This class lets you manage playlists, play files in order, or jump to a specific file by its index. It also provides methods for skipping tracks, adjusting volume, and retrieving metadata for the currently playing file.

I focused on making the API intuitive, with methods like start(), pause(status), set_volume(vol), and meta(tag), among others. These methods return informative strings, which can be printed or used further in your scripts.

### Supported formats

*playmedia* supports a wide range of media formats, including:

- .m4a
- .flac
- .mp3
- .mp4
- .wav
- .wma
- .aac
- .mkv

This broad support ensures that users can work with nearly any media file they have.
